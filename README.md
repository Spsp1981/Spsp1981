Hi, Iâ€™m Sebastian (@Spsp1981). I'm an enthusiast software developer/PC support guy from Argentina. I started programming in GW-BASIC when I was 12 years old and over the years, half self-taught and half academic-taught, I've learned and worked with several languages including VB/VBA, C/C++, Pascal, Java, ASP, SQL, ABAP, etc.
Right from the start, I've been a freelance PC support guy for family and friends and for the last 10 years I've been doing  SAP Netweaver BW support for a couple of IT Services companies. Now I've decided to update myself into current coding technologies starting with PowerShell, VS Code, Git, etc.
